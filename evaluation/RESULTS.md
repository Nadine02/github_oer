	- Changes of materials
		- Creating and editing materials (commits)
		- Division of contents (branch)
	- Reuse of materials
		- Copy of materials (forks)
		- Further development of materials (commits ahead) 
	- Cooperative use 
		- Internal employees (contributors)
		- External exchange (pull requests)
