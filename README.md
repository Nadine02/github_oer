# Open Educatational Resources on GitHub

## Project

This repository contains data and results of a research project which explores how GitHub is used as a version control platform for storing and using educational materials. 

Firstly GitHub repos were analysed by means of different criteria to figure out educational material as part of repos (see [analysis](https://github.com/Nadine02/github_oer/tree/master/analysis))

Data of identifies repos as educational material and of forked repos were crawled using Python-Scripts via the GitHub API (see [crawling](https://github.com/Nadine02/github_oer/tree/master/crawling))

Information of these repos and forks were used to evaluate to which extend processes of versioning are applied in educational scenarios (see [evaluation](https://github.com/Nadine02/github_oer/tree/master/evaluation))
